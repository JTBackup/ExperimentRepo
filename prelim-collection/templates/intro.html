            <strong>Important:</strong> This is a two-part study designed to investigate your lived experiences and perceptions around social media and privacy through both open-ended audio-visual questions and responses to a series of standard scales.
            <br><br>
            For this part of the study, <strong>you are required to have access to both a microphone and camera</strong> so that you can provide your audio-visual responses. In addition, <strong>the study must be taken from a desktop or laptop computer using <u>Google Chrome</u></strong>, as the study does not support mobile devices or other browsers.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Please do not continue if you do not currently have access to a computer with Google Chrome, a microphone, and a webcam.</strong>
