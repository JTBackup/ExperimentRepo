        <h3>Purpose of the Study:</h3>
        <p>
            This study was designed to investigate the psychological impacts of viewing a deepfake video of oneself. 
            This study represents one of the first empirical studies on the topic of deepfakes and digital deception. 
            Our aim was to explore changes in self-perception, trust in digital media, and emotional reactions to seeing oneself in a manipulated video.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Your Participation:</h3>
        <p>
            During the study, you provided a video of yourself, which was then used to create a deepfake - a video manipulated using artificial intelligence to alter or replace content. 
            You were shown this deepfake alongside control videos and asked to respond to various questions and measures.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Important Information about Deepfakes:</h3>
        <p>
            Deepfake technology allows for the creation of convincing but entirely fabricated video content. 
            It's important to understand that the deepfake video you saw was artificially generated and does not reflect real actions or statements made by you.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Confidentiality and Use of Data:</h3>
        <p>
            All information collected in this study, including the deepfake video, is confidential. 
            These materials will not be shared outside the research team and will be securely stored and eventually destroyed within 5 years in accordance with ethical research practices. 
            Your deepfake has already been destroyed and will not be stored within our servers.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Emotional Support:</h3>
        <p>
            We recognize that viewing a deepfake of oneself can be unsettling.
